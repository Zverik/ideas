title: Watchcat JOSM Plugin
status: idea
---

This is a simple watcher plugin for JOSM. It regularly downloads diff files (minutely/hourly/daily, depending
on how long ago JOSM was last used) and monitors changes for given objects. It would be highly useful for
posessive mappers who don't like their objects touched, but also for mappers concerned with validity of
public transport or bicycle routes, or for watching a state of disputable features.
