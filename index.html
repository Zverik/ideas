<h2>Tags Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p>In the first year of learning OpenStreetMap users are keeping <em>Map Features</em> open at all times.
It is too big and complex, a number of cheat sheets would be handier.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="route_plugin/">
<h2>Route Editing Plugin for JOSM</h2>
<p>The current relation editing is too generic, and there should be a plugin
specifically for editing public transport relations.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="web_rollback/">
<h2>Changeset Rollback Web-Interface</h2>
<p>At the moment you can undo a changeset using either a JOSM plugin or a perl script.
Undoing changes should be easier, like in Wikipedia: click, wait, make some simple decisions, done.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="watchcat/">
<h2>Possessive Mappers' Plugin for JOSM</h2>
<p>We have tools for monitoring areas and users, but some mappers would like to
watch certain objects, like relations, to quickly fix accidental edits to them.</p>
</a></div>
