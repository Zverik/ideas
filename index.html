<div class="idea"><a href="cheat_sheet/">
<h2>Tags Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p>In the first year of learning OpenStreetMap users are keeping <em>Map Features</em> open at all times.
It is too big and complex, a number of cheat sheets would be handier.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="route_plugin/">
<h2>Route Editing Plugin for JOSM</h2>
<p>The current relation editing is too generic, and there should be a plugin
specifically for editing public transport relations.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="web_rollback/">
<h2>Changeset Rollback Web-Interface</h2>
<p>At the moment you can undo a changeset using either a JOSM plugin or a perl script.
Undoing changes should be easier, like in Wikipedia: click, wait, make some simple decisions, done.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="watchcat/">
<h2>Possessive Mappers' Plugin for JOSM</h2>
<p>We have tools for monitoring areas and users, but some mappers would like to
watch certain objects, like relations, to quickly fix accidental edits to them.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="feedback/">
<h2>Changeset Feedback</h2>
<p>The only way you can ask a user of a changeset now is to write them a private message.
It enforces negativity in the community and prevents introverts from communicating.
Let's add a thank you button and comments.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="minute/">
<h2>A minute of OpenStreetMap</h2>
<p>Daily video feature about OSM news.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="extracto/">
<h2>Automated user-friendly extracts</h2>
<p>A set of scripts to make nested extracts in pbf, shp and other formats.
All configurable from web interface: install on a droplet, upload config, run.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="imcentral/">
<h2>Imagery Central</h2>
<p>A proxy web service to query imagery providers for detailed imagery and cache the results.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="dashcamref/">
<h2>Dashcam Referencer</h2>
<p>A stand-alone application for extracting frames from a dashcam video and georeferencing them
based on a GPX trace.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="overmap/">
<h2>Video Map Overlay</h2>
<p>Video + GPX trace = mini-map in a corner.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="pwp/">
<h2>Proper Walking Papers</h2>
<p>Modern walking papers producing services are old and unreliable. We should have a net-independent,
MapCSS-based vector printing solution.</p>
</a></div>

<div class="idea"><a href="geotiff/">
<h2>GeoTIFF Processor</h2>
<p>A web interface for automatic processing of GeoTIFF and Landsat images and making a single tile layer out of them.</p>
</a></div>
