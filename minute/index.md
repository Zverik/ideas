title: A minute of OpenStreetMap
status: idea
---

A daily youtube video that showcases what's happened in OpenStreetMap yesterday, or before that.
Short intro, background music, English announcer, subtitles in several languages. A minute allows for
several brief news (smb blogged smth, new version of smth released, etc) or a dive into visual news:
for example, new osm.org style release can be illustrated for each point.

Such regular feature would require around an hour of time, probably for several people (e.g. announcer,
newsperson, writer, animator). Not sure if this can be made 7 times a week, but 5 -- why not?
